# Welcome to Ludan's pages

## Profile

15+ years of embedded systems experience. Skilled in software development and integration on embedded Linux and Android. In the past 5 years, I've been involved in machine/deep learning accelerated by heterogeneous computing, ideally with GPU (OpenCL, CUDA), FPGA, DSP. Nowadays, my project is to research and develop unsupervised learning for defect inspection.
