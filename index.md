## Profile

15+ years of embedded systems experience. Skilled in software development and integration on embedded Linux and Android. Recently, I've been involved in machine/deep learning accelerated by heterogeneous computing, ideally with GPU, FPGA, DSP (OpenCL, CUDA) for the past 5 years. Nowadays, my project is unsupervised learning implemented in TensorFlow.
